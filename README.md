A pytest plugin for filtering unittest-based test classes


## Description

`pytest` has `unittest`-based tests [support out of the box][pytest-docs-unittest]. It eases incremental transition from legacy test suite to `pytest` for existing projects, but it has one drawback: there is no way to exclude some test cases (`unittest.TestCase` subclasses) from collection. `pytest` has `python_classes` [config option][pytest-docs-python-classes-option], but, as noted in documentation, this option doesn't affect `unittest.TestCase` subclasses:

> Note that unittest.TestCase derived classes are always collected regardless of this option, as unittestâ€˜s own collection framework is used to collect those tests.

It's probably OK for projects that uses builtin `unittest` test runner (`python -m unittest`) because the latter has no any include/exclude option either, but it can be inconvenient if a project test suite is used with `nose` test runner and relies on [hard-coded][nose-src-underscore-exclude] leading underscore filter.

The plugin provides two new config options: `python_unittest_classes` and `python_unittest_exclude_underscore`.

### `python_unittest_classes`

This option works like the `python_classes` option mentioned above but for `unittest.TestCase` subclasses:

> One or more name prefixes or glob-style patterns determining which classes are considered for test collection. Search for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between patterns.

A default value is _none_ (no value), i.e. all `unittest.TestCase` subclasses are collected by default.

#### Examples

* to include only classes with names starting with `Test` or `Check`:

  ```ini
  [pytest]
  python_unittest_classes = Test* Check*
  ```

  or alternatively:

  ```ini
  [pytest]
  python_unittest_classes = Test Check
  ```

* to include only classes with names ending with `TestCase`:

  ```ini
  [pytest]
  python_unittest_classes = *TestCase
  ```

* to exclude classes with names starting with underscore:

  ```ini
  [pytest]
  python_unittest_classes = [!_]*
  ```

### `python_unittest_exclude_underscore`

This boolean option can be used to mimic [hard-coded][nose-src-underscore-exclude] nose selector behaviour. If the option set to `true`, all classes with names that start with `_` will be excluded. Thus, the last example above can be rewritten as following:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_exclude_underscore = true
```

A default value is `false`.

Both options can be combined. The following two examples are equivalent:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = [!_]*Test [!_]*Check
```

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = *Test *Check
python_unittest_exclude_underscore = true
```


## Changelog

### 0.2.0 (2019-01-11)

* Added `python_unittest_exclude_underscore` option

### 0.1.0 (2018-10-27)

* Initial release
