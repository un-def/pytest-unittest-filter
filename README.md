A pytest plugin for filtering unittest-based test classes


## Description

`pytest` has `unittest`-based tests [support out of the box][pytest-docs-unittest]. It eases incremental transition from legacy test suite to `pytest` for existing projects, but it has one drawback: there is no way to exclude some test cases (`unittest.TestCase` subclasses) from collection. `pytest` has `python_classes` [config option][pytest-docs-python-classes-option], but, as noted in documentation, this option doesn't affect `unittest.TestCase` subclasses:

> Note that unittest.TestCase derived classes are always collected regardless of this option, as unittestâ€˜s own collection framework is used to collect those tests.

It's probably OK for projects that uses builtin `unittest` test runner (`python -m unittest`) because the latter has no any include/exclude option either, but it can be inconvenient if a project test suite is used with `nose` test runner and relies on [hard-coded][nose-src-underscore-exclude] leading underscore filter.

This plugin provides a new config option `python_unittest_classes` that works like the `python_classes` option mentioned above but for `unittest.TestCase` subclasses:

> One or more name prefixes or glob-style patterns determining which classes are considered for test collection. Search for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between patterns.

A default value is _none_ (no value), i.e. all `unittest.TestCase` subclasses are collected by default.


## Examples

* to exclude classes those names start with underscore:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = [!_]*
```

* to include only classes those names start with `Test` or `Check`:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = Test* Check*
```

or alternatively:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = Test Check
```

* to include only classes those names end with `TestCase`:

```ini
[pytest]
python_unittest_classes = *TestCase
```
